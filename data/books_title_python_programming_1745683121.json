      "summary": "Maintaining a practical perspective, Python Programming: A Practical Approach acquaints you with the wonderful world of programming. The book is a starting point for those who want to learn Python programming. The backbone of any programming, which is the data structure and components such as strings, lists, etc., have been illustrated with many examples and enough practice problems to instill a level of self-confidence in the reader. Drawing on knowledge gained directly from teaching Computer Science as a subject and working on a wide range of projects related to ML, AI, deep learning, and blockchain, the authors have tried their best to present the necessary skills for a Python programmer. Once the foundation of Python programming is built and the readers are aware of the exact structure, dimensions, processing, building blocks, and representation of data, they can readily take up their specific problems from the area of interest and solve them with the help of Python. These include, but are not limited to, operators, control flow, strings, functions, module processing, object-oriented programming, exception and file handling, multithreading, synchronization, regular expressions, and Python database programming. This book on Python programming is specially designed to keep readers busy with learning fundamentals and generates a sense of confidence by attempting the assignment problems. We firmly believe that explaining any particular technology deviates from learning the fundamentals of a programming language. This book is focused on helping readers attempt implementation in their areas of interest through the skills imparted through this book. We have attempted to present the real essence of Python programming, which you can confidently apply in real life by using Python as a tool. Salient Features Based on real-world requirements and solution. Simple presentation without avoiding necessary details of the topic. Executable programs on almost every topic. Plenty of exercise questions, designed to test readers’ skills and understanding. Purposefully designed to be instantly applicable, Python Programming: A Practical Approach provides implementation examples so that the described subject matter can be immediately implemented due to the well-known versatility of Python in handling different data types with ease.",

This book can be manual for those who would want to excel in Python programming as well as for those who are new to Python programming and would want to learn. I hope that you will find what follows both instructive and at times entertaining too. The book is designed for programmers who already have some experience of using a modern high level procedural programming language like C/ C++. The book concentrates on the things that are essential to understand Python programming. Those who already know C will find the contents and example code snippets a bit interested. The syntax and coding constructs of Python programming paradigm is nearer to C but not exact. From my point of view, what matters for a programmer is \"Logic\" and \"Syntax\". It has been inevitable for programmers to learn and practice emerging programming paradigms. This is the first edition of the textbook hence a lot of brainstorming was required in order to properly structure each and every chapter. Appendix A addresses exercise questions of \"Python for Everybody\" by Charles R Severance. Appendix B is about Python solution to few commonly found programming problems. All the programs presented in the textbook are tested using PyCharm IDE. I hope the book meets the requirements of student fraternity and remains reachable throughout its multiple entry of editions. Also, PyCharm IDE installation guidelines included in the textbook.",

      "summary": "The history of Python kicked off when Guido van Rossum, the founder of Python, started working on it in the late 1980s. Python is the successor of the ABC programming language. The first Python version was released back in 1991 and has only grown exponentially since then. It now has a vast community that releases the latest updates regularly. Guido van Rossum is also known as the \"Benevolent Dictator for Life\". This title was given to him by the Python community to honor him for his long-term commitment and dedication to the project and for being the project leader for such a long period. Python is a high-level interpreted programming language that is used throughout the world for general-purpose programming. It is an open-source programming language licensed by both the Free Software Foundation (FSF) and Open-Source Initiative (OSI). Like some other programming languages, its source code is also available under the GNU General Public License (GPL). Python 2.x, being the legacy version, was used earlier across the globe. It stopped receiving newer features and security updates after Python 2.7, so people migrated to Python version 3.x. Throughout this book, we will be focusing more on the Python 3.x version, which is the latest and is currently in active development. Before we proceed further, I would like to inform you all that the purpose of writing this book is to make your understanding of Python clearer by explaining technical terms in layman's language with the help of code snippets and practical examples. I also wanted to make sure that the reader does not feel bored while reading the book, so I'll be adding some attractive code snippets that are appealing to the eyes.",

The creator of this programming language was Guido Van Rossum, released first in the year 1991. The multiple supporting programming paradigms made itself unique from other programming languages as it had some outstanding features like unique adaptability, the ability to adopt machine learning, scientific computation, cloud infrastructure and above all web development. Python's role is really commendable in both software development, as well as, web development. This book is helpful for learning everything Python has to offer.By connecting with a database system Python can read and modify files. To create workflows in Software, this language is helpful. Python also supports a dynamic type system, automatic memory management, object-oriented and structured programming. Moreover, this programming language has the potential to support the various concepts in functional and aspect-oriented programming. Where the other programming languages use semicolon or parentheses to complete a command, Python uses new lines to complete it. Python Coding and Programming Python is one of the easiest computer languages to learn. The most striking part of this language is that it is widely used in NASA. The developers should focus on the quality of the source code to simplify its uses. Other programming languages never focused on the code readability, but Python is always ready to strengthen the code readability with the help of English keywords. Writing additional code is not necessary for Python to create custom applications. When you want to learn a language understood by computers, all over the world, you should take the help of this eBook.It supports several programming paradigms like logic programming and design by contract. In late 1980, as a legatee to the ABC language, the python was conceived. The exceptional powerful ideology of this programming language has influenced many other languages, like BOO, GOBRA, JULIA, RUBY, SWIFT, etc, and those languages hire Python designs for their development. Linux for beginners For computers, servers, mainframes, mobile, and embedded devices, Linux is an open-source and community-developed and operating system. As it is an open source OS, the code is free to create Linux. That's why the appropriate skills for the users are necessary, even if they are beginners, so that they can get the best out of the operating system. This is not only used by the web programmers but also by the regular computer or laptop users and even mobile phones. Get hold of the eBook to learn more. As it is a bit different from the popular operating system like Windows or Android, it takes a little bit of time to get the hang of it. The most important thing about Linux that it is free. It is really hard to hack into Linux as it is highly secured. For different types of users, there are different flavors and the available flavors are called 'distributions'.

      "summary": "Would you like to gather big datasets, analyze them, and visualize the results, all in one program? If this describes you, then Introduction to Python Programming for Business and Social Science Applications is the book for you. Authors Frederick Kaefer and Paul Kaefer walk you through each step of the Python package installation and analysis process, with frequent exercises throughout so you can immediately try out the functions you’ve learned. Written in straightforward language for those with no programming background, this book will teach you how to use Python for your research and data analysis. Instead of teaching you the principles and practices of programming as a whole, this application-oriented text focuses on only what you need to know to research and answer social science questions. The text features two types of examples, one set from the General Social Survey and one set from a large taxi trip dataset from a major metropolitan area, to help readers understand the possibilities of working with Python. Chapters on installing and working within a programming environment, basic skills, and necessary commands will get you up and running quickly, while chapters on programming logic, data input and output, and data frames help you establish the basic framework for conducting analyses. Further chapters on web scraping, statistical analysis, machine learning, and data visualization help you apply your skills to your research. More advanced information on developing graphical user interfaces (GUIs) help you create functional data products using Python to inform general users of data who don’t work within Python. First there was IBM® SPSS®, then there was R, and now there′s Python. Statistical software is getting more aggressive - let authors Frederick Kaefer and Paul Kaefer help you tame it with Introduction to Python Programming for Business and Social Science Applications.",

      "summary": "This second edition of Foundations of Python Network Programming targets Python 2.5 through Python 2.7, the most popular production versions of the language. Python has made great strides since Apress released the first edition of this book back in the days of Python 2.3. The advances required new chapters to be written from the ground up, and others to be extensively revised. You will learn fundamentals like IP, TCP, DNS and SSL by using working Python programs; you will also be able to familiarize yourself with infrastructure components like memcached and message queues. You can also delve into network server designs, and compare threaded approaches with asynchronous event-based solutions. But the biggest change is this edition's expanded treatment of the web. The HTTP protocol is covered in extensive detail, with each feature accompanied by sample Python code. You can use your HTTP protocol expertise by studying an entire chapter on screen scraping and you can then test lxml and BeautifulSoup against a real-world web site. The chapter on web application programming now covers both the WSGI standard for component interoperability, as well as modern web frameworks like Django. Finally, all of the old favorites from the first edition are back: E-mail protocols like SMTP, POP, and IMAP get full treatment, as does XML-RPC. You can still learn how to code Python network programs using the Telnet and FTP protocols, but you are likely to appreciate the power of more modern alternatives like the paramiko SSH2 library. If you are a Python programmer who needs to learn the network, this is the book that you want by your side.",
