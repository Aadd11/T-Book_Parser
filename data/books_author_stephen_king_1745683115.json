One of The Atlantic’s Great American Novels of the Past 100 Years! This edition includes all of the new and restored material first published in The Stand: The Complete and Uncut Edition. A patient escapes from a biological testing facility, unknowingly carrying a deadly weapon: a mutated strain of super-flu that will wipe out 99 percent of the world’s population within a few weeks. Those who remain are scared, bewildered, and in need of a leader. Two emerge—Mother Abagail, the benevolent 108-year-old woman who urges them to build a peaceful community in Boulder, Colorado; and Randall Flagg, the nefarious “Dark Man,” who delights in chaos and violence. As the dark man and the peaceful woman gather power, the survivors will have to choose between them—and ultimately decide the fate of all humanity. \"A master storyteller.\"—Los Angeles Times",

Barton Dawes is standing in the way of progress when his unremarkable but comfortable existence suddenly takes a turn for the worst. A new highway extension is being built right over the laundry plant where he works—and right over his home. The house he has lived in for twenty years and where he created loving memories with his family. Dawes isn’t the sort of man who will take an insult of this magnitude lying down. His steadfast determination to fight the inevitable course of progress drives his wife and friends away while he tries to face down the uncaring bureaucracy that has destroyed his life. But before the city paves over that part of Dawes’s life, he’s got one more party to throw—and it’ll be a blast. What happens when one good (and angry) man fights back…and then some? This #1 national bestseller includes an introduction by Stephen King on “The Importance of Being Bachman.”",

Paul Sheldon is a bestselling novelist who has finally met his number one fan. Her name is Annie Wilkes, and she is more than a rabid reader--she is Paul's nurse, tending his shattered body after an automobile accident. But she is also furious that the author has killed off her favorite character in his latest book. Annie becomes his captor, keeping him prisoner in her isolated house. Annie wants Paul to write a book that brings Misery back to life--just for her. She has a lot of ways to spur him on. One is a needle. Another is an axe. And if they don't work, she can get really nasty. \"Terrifying\" (San Francisco Chronicle), \"dazzlingly well-written\" (The Indianapolis Star), and \"truly gripping\" (Publishers Weekly), Misery is \"classic Stephen King...full of twists and turns and mounting suspense\" (The Boston Globe).",

Part memoir, part master class by one of the bestselling authors of all time, this superb volume is a revealing and practical view of the writer’s craft, comprising the basic tools of the trade every writer must have. King’s advice is grounded in his vivid memories from childhood through his emergence as a writer, from his struggling early career to his widely reported, near-fatal accident in 1999—and how the inextricable link between writing and living spurred his recovery. Brilliantly structured, friendly and inspiring, On Writing will empower and entertain everyone who reads it—fans, writers, and anyone who loves a great story well told.",

Did you know. . . ? In his early teens, Stephen King sold typed copies of his short stories at school. King originally thought his novel Pet Sematary was too frightening to publish. King’s legendary Dark Tower series took him more than 30 years to write. Thinner was the novel that revealed his “Richard Bachman” pseudonym to the world. King wrote The Eyes of the Dragon for his daughter Naomi. He has never liked Stanley Kubrick’s film version of his novel The Shining. It took him four years to write what some consider his magnum opus, IT. The 2017 film version of IT has grossed more than $700 million worldwide. In addition to novels, King has written essays, plays, screenplays, and even poetry.",

But Carrie has a gift and she uses this gift to inflict a terrifying revenge. In 'Salem's Lot, Ben Mears has returned to Jerusalem's Lot, an old mansion, long the subject of town lore, to work on his new book. But when two young boys venture into the woods and only one comes out alive, Mears begins to realize that there is something evil growing within the borders of this small New England town. In The Shining, Jack Torrance's new job as the off-season caretaker at the Overlook Hotel is the perfect chance for a fresh start. But as the harsh winter weather sets in, the idyllic location feels ever more remote . . . and more sinister. And the only one to notice the strange and terrible forces gathering around the Overlook is Danny Torrance, a uniquely gifted five-year-old.",

Although Scott Carey doesn’t look any different, he’s been steadily losing weight. There are a couple of other odd things, too. He weighs the same in his clothes and out of them, no matter how heavy they are. Scott doesn’t want to be poked and prodded. He mostly just wants someone else to know, and he trusts Doctor Bob Ellis. In the small town of Castle Rock, the setting of many of King’s most iconic stories, Scott is engaged in a low grade—but escalating—battle with the lesbians next door whose dog regularly drops his business on Scott’s lawn. One of the women is friendly; the other, cold as ice. Both are trying to launch a new restaurant, but the people of Castle Rock want no part of a gay married couple, and the place is in trouble. When Scott finally understands the prejudices they face—including his own—he tries to help. Unlikely alliances, the annual foot race, and the mystery of Scott’s affliction bring out the best in people who have indulged the worst in themselves and others. “Written in masterly Stephen King’s signature translucent…this uncharacteristically glimmering fairy tale calls unabashedly for us to rise above our differences” (Booklist, starred review). Elevation is an antidote to our divisive culture, an “elegant whisper of a story” (Kirkus Reviews, starred review), “perfect for any fan of small towns, magic, and the joys and challenges of doing the right thing” (Publishers Weekly, starred review).",

      "summary": "This box set features three bestselling works from internationally famous horror author, Stephen King. The undisputed King of Horror delivers in these three spine-tingling books that are sure to keep you up at night. Lisey’s Story is the story of a writer’s widow who must confront his demons after his death. Two years ago, Lisey Debusher Landon lost her husband, Scott, an award-winning, bestselling novelist and a very complicated man. Lisey knew there was a place Scott went—a place that both terrified and healed him, that could eat him alive or give him the ideas he needed in order to live. Now it’s Lisey’s turn to face Scott’s demons, Lisey’s turn to go to Boo’ya Moon. What begins as a widow’s effort to sort through the papers of her celebrated husband becomes a nearly fatal journey into the darkness he inhabited. Perhaps King’s most personal and powerful novel, Lisey’s Story is about the wellsprings of creativity, the temptations of madness, and the secret language of love. Featuring fourteen horrific short stories, Everything’s Eventual is King in terrifying top form with stories that will keep you awake until daybreak. King takes readers down a road less traveled (for good reason) in the blockbuster ebook “Riding the Bullet.” Bad table service turns bloody when you stop in for “Lunch at the Gotham Café,” and terror becomes déjà vu all over again when you get “That Feeling, You Can Only Say What It Is in French.” Enter a nightmarish mindscape of unrelenting horror and shocking revelations that could only come from the imagination of the greatest storyteller of our time. Buckle your seatbelts for Mr. Mercedes. In the frigid pre-dawn hours, in a distressed Midwestern city, desperate unemployed folks are lined up for a spot at a job fair. Without warning, a lone driver plows through the crowd in a stolen Mercedes, running over the innocent, backing up, and charging again. Eight people are killed; fifteen are wounded. The killer escapes. In this high-suspense race against time, three of the most unlikely heroes Stephen King has ever created try to stop a lone killer from blowing up thousands. Mr. Mercedes is a war between good and evil, from the master of suspense whose insight into the mind of this obsessed, insane killer is chilling and unforgettable.",

Roland is the last of his kind, a “gunslinger” charged with protecting whatever goodness and light remains in his world—a world that “moved on,” as they say. In this desolate reality—a dangerous land filled with ancient technology and deadly magic, and yet one that mirrors our own in frightening ways—Roland is on a spellbinding and soul-shattering quest to locate and somehow save the mystical nexus of all worlds, all universes: the Dark Tower. Now, in the graphic novel series Stephen King’s The Dark Tower: Beginnings, originally published by Marvel Comics in single-issue form and creatively overseen by Stephen King himself, the full story of Roland's troubled past and coming-of-age is revealed. Sumptuously drawn by Jae Lee and Richard Isanove, plotted by longtime Stephen King expert Robin Furth, and scripted by New York Times bestselling author Peter David, Beginnings is an extraordinary and terrifying journey into Roland’s origins—ultimately serving as the perfect introduction for new readers to Stephen King’s modern literary classic The Dark Tower, while giving longtime fans thrilling adventures merely hinted at in his blockbuster novels. This single-volume omnibus edition includes the complete graphic novel series Beginnings: The Gunslinger Born; The Long Road Home; Treachery; The Fall of Gilead; The Battle of Jericho Hill.",

      "summary": "*#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER* Featuring the novella “The Life of Chuck,” now a feature film adapted for the screen and directed by Mike Flanagan (The Fall of the House of Usher, Doctor Sleep) and starring Tom Hiddleston, Mark Hamill, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Karen Gillan—a Toronto International Film Festival People’s Choice Award winner! From the legendary storyteller and master of short fiction Stephen King comes an extraordinary collection of four new “exceptionally compelling novellas that reaffirm [King’s] mastery of the form” (The Washington Post). Readers adore Stephen King’s novels, and his novellas are their own dark treat, briefer but just as impactful and enduring as his longer fiction. Many of his novellas have been made into iconic films, including “The Body” (Stand by Me) and “Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption” (Shawshank Redemption). The four brilliant tales in If It Bleeds prove as iconic as their predecessors. In the title story, reader favorite Holly Gibney (from the Mr. Mercedes trilogy and The Outsider) must face her fears, and possibly another outsider—this time on her own. In “Mr. Harrigan’s Phone” an intergenerational friendship has a disturbing afterlife. “The Life of Chuck” explores, beautifully, how each of us contains multitudes. And in “Rat,” a struggling writer must contend with the darker side of ambition. If these novellas show King’s range, they also prove that certain themes endure. One of King’s great concerns is evil, and in If It Bleeds, there’s plenty of it. There is also evil’s opposite, which in King’s fiction often manifests as friendship. Holly is reminded that friendship is not only life-affirming but can be life-saving. Young Craig befriends Mr. Harrigan, and the sweetness of this late-in-life connection is its own reward. “An adroit vehicle to showcase the…nature of evil” (The Boston Globe), If It Bleeds is “exactly what I wanted to read right now,” says Ruth Franklin in The New York Times Book Review.",

      "summary": "\"Over the past thirty years, Stephen King has received enormous attention from both the popular press as well as academics seeking to explain the unique phenomenon of his success. Books on King explore his canon in religious contexts, in political and historical contexts, in mythic-specifically Jungian-contexts, in Gothic/horror (especially American literary) contexts, and in a wide variety of other contexts appropriate to a writer who, over the past half century, has become \"America's Storyteller.\" Beginning with a never-published chapter authored by Stephen King himself on the influence of the genre on his own writing, King Noir makes an invaluable contribution to King scholarship by placing King's works in conversation with American crime fiction. This is the third book that Tony Magistrale and Michael J. Blouin have coauthored on the work of Stephen King, and the first to consider King's canon through the lens of crime fiction. King Noir examines not only King's own efforts at writing in the detective genre, but also how the detective genre finds its way into work typically regarded as horror fiction. In interviews, King has acknowledged his debt to earlier writers in the genre, such as Ed McBain and Raymond Chandler, and he much more often references hardboiled writers than he does horror writers. One could speculate that King became a writer because of his love of pulpy crime fiction, which he continues to hold in high esteem. From The Dead Zone to Mr. Mercedes, from the crime fiction of his pseudonym Richard Bachman to his most recent novel Holly, King returns obsessively to patterns established by American sleuths of every stripe, paying homage to them at the same time as he innovates on the formulas he has inherited. To focus upon a hardboiled Stephen King is to discover exciting new avenues for inquiry into one of America's most enduring, and adaptable, storytellers\"--",

Roland is the last of his kind, a “gunslinger” charged with protecting whatever goodness and light remains in his world—a world that “moved on,” as they say. In this desolate reality—a dangerous land filled with ancient technology and deadly magic, and yet one that mirrors our own in frightening ways—Roland is on a spellbinding and soul-shattering quest to locate and somehow save the mystical nexus of all worlds, all universes: the Dark Tower. Now, in the first in the graphic novel series adaptation Stephen King’s The Dark Tower: The Drawing of the Three, originally published by Marvel Comics in single-issue form and creatively overseen by Stephen King himself, the full story of Roland’s saga continues. Sumptuously drawn by Piotr Kowalski, Jonathan Marks, Juanan Ramirez, and Cory Hamscher, plotted by longtime Stephen King expert Robin Furth, and scripted by New York Times bestselling author Peter David, The Drawing of the Three adaptation is an extraordinary and terrifying journey—ultimately introducing a generation of new readers to Stephen King’s modern literary classic The Dark Tower, while giving longtime fans thrilling adventures transformed from his blockbuster novels.",

He may have been the greatest player the game has ever seen, but today no one remembers his name. He was the first--and only--player to have his existence completely removed from the record books. Even his team is long forgotten, barely a footnote in the game's history. Every effort was made to erase any evidence that William Blakely played professional baseball, and with good reason. Blockade Billy had a secret darker than any pill or injection that might cause a scandal in sports today. His secret was much, much worse... and only Stephen King, the most gifted storyteller of our age, can reveal the truth to the world, once and for all. This original, never-before-published novella represents Stephen King at his very best, and this Cemetery Dance hardcover edition brings it into print for the very first time",

      "summary": "Fasten your seatbelts for an anthology of turbulent tales curated by Stephen King and Bev Vincent. This exciting new collection, perfect for airport or aeroplane reading, includes an original introduction and story notes for each story by Stephen King, and brand new stories from Stephen King and Joe Hill. Stephen King hates to fly. Now he and co-editor Bev Vincent would like to share this fear of flying with you. Welcome to Flight or Fright, an anthology about all the things that can go horribly wrong when you're suspended six miles in the air, hurtling through space at more than 500 mph and sealed up in a metal tube (like - gulp! - a coffin) with hundreds of strangers. All the ways your trip into the friendly skies can turn into a nightmare, including some we'll bet you've never thought of before... but now you will the next time you walk down the jetway and place your fate in the hands of a total stranger. Featuring brand new stories by Joe Hill and Stephen King, as well as fourteen classic tales and one poem from the likes of Richard Matheson, Ray Bradbury, Roald Dahl, Dan Simmons, and many others, Flight or Fright is, as King says, \"ideal airplane reading, especially on stormy descents... Even if you are safe on the ground, you might want to buckle up nice and tight.\" Book a flight for this terrifying new anthology that will have you thinking twice about how you want to reach your final destination.

Pocos se escapan de su fuerza y estos tendrán que sobrevivir en un mundo totalmente transformado. Clayton Riddell no tiene teléfono móvil, su esposa, Sharon, tampoco. Están separados pero en contacto constante por su hijo Johnny Gee. Sus padres le han regalado un móvil para cosas urgentes. Saben que muy a menudo no lo lleva encima y por eso le riñen. El uno de octubre Clay viaja a Boston por una entrevista de trabajo y de repente cuando pasea por el parque es testigo de escenas espeluznantes, escenas totalmente inexplicables: gente en la calle que hablando por el móvil se convierten repentinamente en monstruos asesinos, atacan y matan a todos los de su alrededor. Los coches chocan entre sí. Es una escena de caos sangriento, incendios, alarmas.. . incomprensible. Ya no hay canales de radio ni televisión, ni servicios de ningún tipo. Nada que pueda poner orden. Clay entiende que todo ha sido causado por un mensaje a través de los móviles. Consigue refugiarse en un hotel junto con otro hombre Tom McCourt y una adolescente, Alice, los dos sin móvil. Deciden abandonar la ciudad para averiguar si la situación es la misma en el resto del país. Para Clay, lo más importante es localizar a su hijo que, espera que hoy no lleve su móvil encima. Los tres emprenden su viaje a pie hacia la ciudad donde vive Johnny y su madre. Andan de noche cuando los locos no se mueven. De día se esconden en casas abandonadas. En su camino se encuentran con otros que se han salvado pero son pocos y descubren que los locos se han convertido en una especie de zombies telepáticos. Estos se juntan de día en grandes masas, llamados por música transmitida por altavoces, en estadios de deportes. De noche duermen. Están controlados por los sonidos. Andan y andan hacia un solo destino. La mujer de Clay ha sido víctima de la gran destrucción pero su hijo parece haber sobrevivido y Clay y sus dos compañeros siguen su pista. Van de ciudad en ciudad, entre cadáveres y zombies asesinos, entre el caos y la destrucción, hasta llegar a la ciudad de su destino. Y allí Clay encontrará a Johnny, no el Johnny de antes, pero quizás algún día aprenderá de nuevo a ser un niño “normal”. El mensaje de los móviles va perdiendo toda su fuerza pero...el mundo nunca volverá a ser lo mismo.",

      "summary": "NAMED A NEW YORK TIMES BOOK REVIEW TOP 10 HORROR BOOK OF 2024 WINNER OF THE GOODREADS CHOICE AWARD FOR HORROR “Stephen King knows You Like It Darker and obliges with sensational new tales” (USA TODAY): From legendary storyteller and master of short fiction Stephen King, an extraordinary collection of stories that are “a master class in tension and full of King’s dark humor” (The New York Times Book Review)—now with a bonus story, “The Music Room.” “You like it darker? Fine, so do I,” writes Stephen King in the afterword to this magnificent new collection of twelve stories that delve into the darker part of life—both metaphorical and literal. King has, for half a century, been a master of the form, and these stories, about fate, mortality, luck, and the folds in reality where anything can happen, are as rich and riveting as his novels, both weighty in theme and a huge pleasure to read. King writes to feel “the exhilaration of leaving ordinary day-to-day life behind,” and in You Like It Darker, readers will feel that exhilaration too, again and again. “Two Talented Bastids” explores the long-hidden secret of how the eponymous gentlemen got their skills. In “Danny Coughlin’s Bad Dream,” a brief and unprecedented psychic flash upends dozens of lives, Danny’s most catastrophically. In “Rattlesnakes,” a sequel to Cujo, a grieving widower travels to Florida for respite and instead receives an unexpected inheritance—with major strings attached. In “The Dreamers,” a taciturn Vietnam vet answers a job ad and learns that there are some corners of the universe best left unexplored. “The Answer Man” asks if prescience is good luck or bad and reminds us that a life marked by unbearable tragedy can still be meaningful. “King’s skills as a storyteller remain undimmed” (The Minnesota Star Tribune) and his ability to surprise, amaze, and bring us both terror and solace is unsurpassed. “The titular darkness promised is as riveting and all-consuming as ever” (New York magazine). You like it darker? You got it.",

      "summary": "Enter once more the world of Roland Deschain—and the world of the Dark Tower...now presented in a stunning graphic novel form that will unlock the doorways to terrifying secrets and bold storytelling as part of the dark fantasy masterwork and magnum opus from #1 New York Times bestselling author Stephen King. “The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed.” With these unforgettable words, millions of readers were introduced to Stephen King’s iconic character Roland Deschain of Gilead. Roland is the last of his kind, a “gunslinger” charged with protecting whatever goodness and light remains in his world—a world that “moved on,” as they say. In this desolate reality—a dangerous land filled with ancient technology and deadly magic, and yet one that mirrors our own in frightening ways—Roland is on a spellbinding and soul-shattering quest to locate and somehow save the mystical nexus of all worlds, all universes: the Dark Tower. Now, in the graphic novel series Stephen King's The Dark Tower: Beginnings, originally published by Marvel Comics in single-issue form and creatively overseen by Stephen King himself, the full story of Roland's troubled past and coming-of-age is revealed. Sumptuously drawn by Jae Lee and Richard Isanove, plotted by longtime Stephen King expert Robin Furth, and scripted by New York Times bestselling author Peter David, Beginnings is an extraordinary and terrifying journey into Roland’s origins—ultimately serving as the perfect introduction for new readers to Stephen King’s modern literary classic The Dark Tower, while giving longtime fans thrilling adventures merely hinted at in his blockbuster novels. Roland Deschain of Gilead and his ka-tet of Cuthbert Allgood and Alain Johns may have finally returned home, but all is not well in the crown jewel of Mid-World. Roland has voluntarily kept the stolen evil seeing sphere nicknamed “Maerlyn's Grapefruit”—lost in his obsession with peering into its pinkish depths, despite the devastating toll it takes on his health...and what the young gunslinger sees within the glass heralds the darkest of nightmares. Meanwhile, all around him, danger lurks in every form, as the shocking and horrific machinations of Gilead’s sworn enemy, “the Good Man” John Farson, threatens all Roland holds dear and in ways he could never imagine...the cruel hand of fate about to push him inexorably closer along the path to the Dark Tower.",

Roland is the last of his kind, a “gunslinger” charged with protecting whatever goodness and light remains in his world—a world that “moved on,” as they say. In this desolate reality—a dangerous land filled with ancient technology and deadly magic, and yet one that mirrors our own in frightening ways—Roland is on a spellbinding and soul-shattering quest to locate and somehow save the mystical nexus of all worlds, all universes: the Dark Tower. Now, in the graphic novel series adaptation Stephen King's The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger, originally published by Marvel Comics in single-issue form and creatively overseen by Stephen King himself, the full story of Roland's troubled past and ongoing saga is revealed. Sumptuously drawn by Richard Isanove, Sean Phillips, Luke Ross, and Michael Lark, plotted by longtime Stephen King expert Robin Furth, and scripted by New York Times bestselling author Peter David, The Gunslinger adaptation is an extraordinary and terrifying journey—ultimately serving as the perfect introduction for new readers to Stephen King’s modern literary classic The Dark Tower, while giving longtime fans thrilling adventures transformed from his blockbuster novels. Following the road through the Mohaine Desert, Roland continues his epic search for the elusive Man in Black. Instead, he finds Tull, the last stop of civilization. A town of devil grass, desert sand, and despair…full of nothing, especially mercy. It may seem Tull is on the very edge of the world, with little past the horizon but a steep fall to oblivion. But Roland believes otherwise…that beyond the limits of Tull lies a hidden truth that means everything to the fate of Mid-World. The Man in Black holds the key to that mystery, and Roland is going to keep following him—even through a deadly trap set here in this town—to unlock it.",

It's mine - that was what he had thought when his finger had pushed the shutter-button for the first time. Now he found himself wondering if maybe he hadn't gotten that backward. Kevin Delevan wants only one thing for his fifteenth birthday: a Polaroid Sun 660. There's something wrong with his gift, though. No matter where Kevin aims the camera, it produces a photograph of an enormous, vicious dog. In each successive picture, the menacing creature draws nearer to the flat surface of the Polaroid film as if it intends to break through. When old Pop Merrill, Castle Rock's sharpest trader, gets wind of this phenomenon, he devises a way to profit from it. But the Sun Dog, a beast that shouldn't exist at all, turns out to be a very dangerous investment.",

      "summary": "*THE NUMBER ONE BESTSELLER* Holly Gibney, one of Stephen King's most compelling and ingeniously resourceful characters, returns in this thrilling novel to solve the gruesome truth behind multiple disappearances in a Midwestern town. Stephen King's HOLLY marks the triumphant return of beloved King character Holly Gibney. Readers have witnessed Holly's gradual transformation from a shy (but also brave and ethical) recluse in Mr Mercedes to Bill Hodges's partner in Finders Keepers to a full-fledged, smart, and occasionally tough private detective in The Outsider. In King's new novel, Holly is on her own, and up against a pair of unimaginably depraved and brilliantly disguised adversaries. When Penny Dahl calls the Finders Keepers detective agency hoping for help locating her missing daughter, Holly is reluctant to accept the case. Her partner, Pete, has Covid. Her (very complicated) mother has just died. And Holly is meant to be on leave. But something in Penny Dahl's desperate voice makes it impossible for Holly to turn her down. Mere blocks from where Bonnie Dahl disappeared live Professors Rodney and Emily Harris. They are the picture of bourgeois respectability: married octogenarians, devoted to each other, and semi-retired lifelong academics. But they are harbouring an unholy secret in the basement of their well-kept, book-lined home, one that may be related to Bonnie's disappearance. And it will prove nearly impossible to discover what they are up to: they are savvy, they are patient, and they are ruthless. Holly must summon all her formidable talents to outthink and outmanoeuvre the shockingly twisted professors in this chilling new masterwork from Stephen King. 'I could never let Holly Gibney go. She was supposed to be a walk-on character in Mr Mercedes and she just kind of stole the book and stole my heart. Holly is all her.' STEPHEN KING 'Lavished with the kind of dialogue most mortal writers can only dream of crafting ... King's portrait of Holly is sympathetic, subtle and seductive' INDEPENDENT 'King's wonderfully awkward private detective Holly Gibney returns in this black-hearted parable of American life in the Covid era... As horrifying as anything King has written' MAIL ON SUNDAY 'Stephen King's prolific late flowering continues with a new outing for his detective Holly Gibney, chasing down serial killers in Holly' GUARDIAN",

      "summary": "„Unul dintre cei mai mari povestitori contemporani.“ Guardian La începutul pandemiei, legendarul povestitor Stephen King s-a întrebat: „Ce ai putea scrie care să te facă fericit?“ „Ca și cum imaginația mea abia aștepta să-i fie pusă întrebarea, mi s-a arătat un oraș mare și părăsit – dar cu o viață proprie. Am văzut străzile pustii, clădirile bântuite, un cap de gargui care zăcea răsturnat pe stradă. Am văzut statui sfărâmate (nu știam ce reprezintă, dar am aflat în cele din urmă). Am văzut un palat uriaș, impunător, cu turnuri din sticlă atât de înalte, încât vârfurile lor străpungeau norii. Aceste imagini au declanșat povestea pe care voiam să o spun.“ Stephen King Stephen King sondează cel mai adânc puț al imaginației sale în acest roman fermecător despre un adolescent care moștenește cheia către o lume paralelă, în care binele și răul poartă o luptă acerbă. Charlie Reade arată ca un licean obișnuit, priceput la baseball și la fotbal, un elev modest și sârguincios. Când el avea doar zece ani, mama lui a murit într-un accident, iar suferința l-a făcut pe tatăl său să se cufunde în alcool. Maturizat precoce, Charlie a învățat cum să aibă grijă de el însuși, dar și de propriul tată. La vârsta de șaptesprezece ani, adolescentul întâlnește o cățelușă adorabilă pe nume Radar și pe stăpânul ei, Howard Bowditch, un bătrânel singuratic, care trăiește într-o casă mare, situată pe culmea unui deal, având în curtea din spate un șopron ținut sub lacăt. „Stephen King știe cu exactitate de unde izvorăsc poveștile și cum se înrâuresc apoi în fluxul creativ universal ca într-un fluviu nesfârșit și învolburat. Iar cartea aceasta este luată chiar de acolo, din gura izvorului, de unde curg cele mai strălucitoare povești. De acolo de unde au fost luate poveștile lui Peter Pan din Neverland sau cea a lui Atreiu din Fantazia. Cu mențiunea că în textura Unui basm se simte tușa întunecată a unui maestru horror.“ MARIAN COMAN, redactor-șef ARMADA",

      "summary": "This is the Complete Unabridged Collectors Edition of Dracula, the 1897 classic horror novel by Irish author Bram Stoker, featuring as its primary antagonist the vampire Count Dracula. It was first published as a hardcover in 1897 by Archibald Constable and Company. Dracula has been attributed to many literary genres including vampire literature, horror fiction, the gothic novel and invasion literature. Structurally it is an epistolary novel, that is, told as a series of letters, diary entries, ships' logs, etc. Literary critics have examined many themes in the novel, such as the role of women in Victorian culture, conventional and conservative sexuality, immigration, colonialism, postcolonialism and folklore. Dracula has inspired countless movies, books, and plays. But few, if any, have been fully faithful to this, Bram Stoker's original, best-selling novel of mystery and horror, love and death, sin and redemption. Dracula chronicles the vampire's journey from Transylvania to the nighttime streets of London. There, he searches for the blood of strong men and beautiful women while his enemies plot to rid the world of his frightful power. REVIEWS: \"Dracula is a virtual textbook on Victorian repression of the erotic and fear of female sexuality.\" - Playboy \"Before all the vampires of modern cinema and horror novels, there was Bram Stoker's Dracula, the original head honcho of horror. All others pale in comparison.\" - Stephen King \"In this volume, lovingly restored to its original unabridged and untouched glory, the power and majesty of Bram Stoker's masterpiece emerges from the coffin dripping with new life.\" - Fangoria Magazine",
