He knows no spells, has never helped to hatch a dragon, and has never worn a cloak of invisibility. All he knows is a miserable life with the Dursleys, his horrible aunt and uncle, and their abominable son, Dudley - a great big swollen spoiled bully. Harry's room is a tiny closet at the foot of the stairs, and he hasn't had a birthday party in eleven years. But all that is about to change when a mysterious letter arrives by owl messenger: a letter with an invitation to an incredible place that Harry - and anyone who reads about him - will find unforgettable.",

Rowling. «Con las manos temblorosas, Harry le dio la vuelta al sobre y vio un sello de lacre púrpura con un escudo de armas: un león, un águila, un tejón y una serpiente, que rodeaban una gran letra H.» Harry Potter nunca ha oído hablar de Hogwarts hasta que empiezan a caer cartas en el felpudo del número 4 de Privet Drive. Llevan la dirección escrita con tinta verde en un sobre de pergamino amarillento con un sello de lacre púrpura, y sus horripilantes tíos se apresuran a confiscarlas. Más tarde, el día que Harry cumple once años, Rubeus Hagrid, un hombre gigantesco cuyos ojos brillan como escarabajos negros, irrumpe con una noticia extraordinaria: Harry Potter es un mago, y le han concedido una plaza en el Colegio Hogwarts de Magia y Hechicería. ¡Está a punto de comenzar una aventura increíble! ENGLISH DESCRIPTION Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the first volume of British author J.K. Rowling's now classic series of fantasy novels. With trembling hands, Harry turned over the envelope and saw a purple wax seal with a coat of arms: a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a snake, all surrounding a large letter H. Harry Potter has never heard of Hogwarts before, until letters start falling at the doorstep of 4 Privet Drive. The address is written in green ink on a yellowed parchment envelope with a purple wax seal stamped on it, and his repugnant aunt and uncle rush to remove and hide them. Later, on Harry's eleventh birthday, Rubeus Hagrid, a gigantic man whose eyes sparkle like black beetles, shows up with extraordinary news: Harry Potter is a wizard, and he has been awarded a place at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. An incredible adventure is about to begin!",

ENGLISH DESCRIPTION Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is the fourth volume of British author J.K. Rowling’s now classic series of fantasy novels. “There will be three tests, spaced throughout the school year, that will test the champions in many different ways: their magical abilities, their daring, their deduction skills, and of course, their ability to overcome danger.” The Triwizard Tournament is going to be held at Hogwarts. Only students over the age of seventeen are allowed to enter the competition, but even so, Harry dreams of winning it. On Halloween, when the Goblet of Fire chooses the champions, Harry is shocked to see that his name is one of those chosen by the Magic Goblet. During the tournament he will have to face deadly challenges, dragons, and dark wizards, but with the help of his best friends Ron and Hermione, he may just be able to get out alive!",
