Paul Sheldon is a bestselling novelist who has finally met his number one fan. Her name is Annie Wilkes, and she is more than a rabid reader--she is Paul's nurse, tending his shattered body after an automobile accident. But she is also furious that the author has killed off her favorite character in his latest book. Annie becomes his captor, keeping him prisoner in her isolated house. Annie wants Paul to write a book that brings Misery back to life--just for her. She has a lot of ways to spur him on. One is a needle. Another is an axe. And if they don't work, she can get really nasty. \"Terrifying\" (San Francisco Chronicle), \"dazzlingly well-written\" (The Indianapolis Star), and \"truly gripping\" (Publishers Weekly), Misery is \"classic Stephen King...full of twists and turns and mounting suspense\" (The Boston Globe).",

    "summary": "From legendary master storyteller Stephen King, a riveting story about \u201can ordinary man in an extraordinary condition rising above hatred\u201d (The Washington Post) and bringing the fictional town of Castle Rock, Maine together\u2014a \u201cjoyful, uplifting\u201d (Entertainment Weekly) tale about finding common ground despite deep-rooted differences, \u201cthe sign of a master elevating his own legendary game yet again\u201d (USA TODAY). Although Scott Carey doesn\u2019t look any different, he\u2019s been steadily losing weight. There are a couple of other odd things, too. He weighs the same in his clothes and out of them, no matter how heavy they are. Scott doesn\u2019t want to be poked and prodded. He mostly just wants someone else to know, and he trusts Doctor Bob Ellis. In the small town of Castle Rock, the setting of many of King\u2019s most iconic stories, Scott is engaged in a low grade\u2014but escalating\u2014battle with the lesbians next door whose dog regularly drops his business on Scott\u2019s lawn. One of the women is friendly; the other, cold as ice. Both are trying to launch a new restaurant, but the people of Castle Rock want no part of a gay married couple, and the place is in trouble. When Scott finally understands the prejudices they face\u2014including his own\u2014he tries to help. Unlikely alliances, the annual foot race, and the mystery of Scott\u2019s affliction bring out the best in people who have indulged the worst in themselves and others. \u201cWritten in masterly Stephen King\u2019s signature translucent\u2026this uncharacteristically glimmering fairy tale calls unabashedly for us to rise above our differences\u201d (Booklist, starred review). Elevation is an antidote to our divisive culture, an \u201celegant whisper of a story\u201d (Kirkus Reviews, starred review), \u201cperfect for any fan of small towns, magic, and the joys and challenges of doing the right thing\u201d (Publishers Weekly, starred review).",
